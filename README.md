# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug related to gradient rendering in Tailwind CSS.  The issue manifests in some browsers, causing the gradient background to display incorrectly or not at all. The problem is likely due to a combination of browser compatibility issues and potentially conflicting CSS rules.

## Bug Description

The `bg-gradient-to-r` utility, intended to create a smooth gradient, may render inconsistently across various browsers. In some cases, the gradient might appear distorted, incomplete, or absent altogether.

## Solution

The solution involves using a more cross-browser compatible approach or adding fallbacks to ensure the gradient renders as intended across different browser versions.
